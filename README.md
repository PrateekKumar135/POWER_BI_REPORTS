**About Dataset**

Explore the dynamic landscapes of water management with CWC comprehensive dataset on reservoir levels. From fluctuating water levels to storage capacities, this data provides an unparalleled view of reservoir operations across diverse regions. Delve into trends, identify anomalies, and forecast future scenarios through meticulous analysis. Understand how environmental factors and human interventions shape water resources. Use our dataset to fuel research, inform policy decisions, and drive sustainability initiatives. Uncover the hidden patterns of water usage and conservation in this critical exploration of hydro data.

**Column description** :

Reservoir_name: This column lists the names of the reservoirs included in the dataset.

Basin: This column specifies the river basin in which each reservoir is located. River basins are geographical areas determined by the watershed of a river and its tributaries.

Subbasin: A more specific categorization within a river basin, detailing a smaller section or a particular tributary area that contributes water to the reservoir.

Agency_name: The agency responsible for managing the reservoir. In this case, it appears to be the Central Water Commission (CWC).

Lat (Latitude): The latitude coordinate of the reservoir, indicating its north-south position on the Earth's surface.
Long (Longitude): The longitude coordinate of the reservoir, indicating its east-west position.

Date: The specific date on which the data was recorded.

Year: The year in which the data was recorded, here it is consistently 2024.

Month: The month during which the data was collected, indicated here as March (month 3).

Full_reservoir_level (FRL): This is the maximum water level that the reservoir can safely reach.

Live_capacity_FRL: The volume of water (in millions of cubic meters) that the reservoir can hold when filled to the full reservoir level.

Storage: The actual volume of water stored in the reservoir on the recorded date, measured in million cubic meters.

Level: The actual water level in the reservoir on the recorded date, usually measured in meters above sea level.
